# Formality Lexica

The formality feature package currently provided for German is based on *I-ForGer* (Eder, Elisabeth; Krieg-Holz Ulrike and Hahn, Udo. 2021: Acquiring a Formality-Informed Lexical Resource for Style Analysis. Proceedings of the 16th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Main Volume, April 2021, Kyiv, Ukraine, Online, 2028-2041).
